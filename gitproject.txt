add people -> email sent
check email
added? then others: clone
one person - push
others : push error
always pull before push
edit others' files -> pull and push
one edit his files -> wipes off his changes when pull
so should commit before pull

---
Follow these steps-

Add your files to the commit-

git add <filename>
Commit those files with a commit message-

git commit -m "added blah feature"
Then, Pull(preferably rebase) to get the latest code from the repo-

git pull --rebase
Then push(YAY!)-

git push -u origin master
About what they would have meant(looking at Jenkins CI thing you told)-

First pull the code(hard reset also maybe, as I do it sometimes) from repo to your local directory. Then if you have a separate branch or different local working directory, make changes from there to this new location(pull) and then commit your changes. Then finally push.
